# Simple CPU Architecture Simulator

This is a simple CPU architecture simulator written in Python. The simulator emulates a custom instruction set architecture with 4 general-purpose registers and a 64-bit address space. The instruction set includes basic arithmetic and bitwise logical operations, memory operations (e.g., LOAD/STORE or MOV), as well as support for user input and output.

## Features

### Arithmetic Operations:

- Addition (ADD)
- Subtraction (SUB)

### Bitwise Logical Operations:

- AND (AND)
- OR (OR)
- NOT (NOT)

### Memory Operations:

- Load (LOAD)
- Store (STORE)
- Move (MOV)

### Input/Output:

- User input from the keyboard
- Display output on the screen
  
### Debugging Support:

- Single-step execution
- View register values and memory addresses at breakpoints
